## Purpose
Bazos integration keeps the Bazos marketplace aligned with the shared catalog, stock, and order contracts.

## Responsibilities
- synchronize marketplace product data from the shared catalog and warehouse contracts
- consume shared event-bus updates that affect stock and marketplace states
- forward relevant order workflows into the shared orders microservice

## Non-responsibilities
- ownership of payment settlement or invoicing
- creation of a new catalog source of truth
- direct local order lifecycle management

## Inputs
- catalog and stock state from the shared ecosystem
- event-bus signals such as stock.updated
- platform monitoring and logging outputs

## Outputs
- marketplace synchronization actions
- operational health and traceability evidence
- valid repo-level governance records

## Dependencies
- catalog-microservice
- warehouse-microservice
- orders-microservice
- logging-microservice
- monitoring-microservice
- shared event bus

## Upstream traceability
This repo follows the same project governance model and shared platform contracts used across the Alfares ecosystem.
